# Business-Name-Generator
This mini project is a Business Name Generator made using Vanilla JavaScript. It works by randomly selecting words from predefined lists and combining them into a unique business name every time the program is executed. It showcases the use of functions, Math.random(), and conditional logic in JavaScript.
