# 💡 Business Name Generator

This mini project is a Business Name Generator built with Vanilla JavaScript that randomly combines predefined words to create a unique business name each time it runs.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The program selects:

* One word from a **prefix list** (Crazy, Amazing, Fire)
* One word from an **industry list** (Engine, Foods, Garments)
* One word from a **suffix list** (Bros, Limited, Hub)

These three words are joined together to generate a creative and random business name every time the program is executed.
